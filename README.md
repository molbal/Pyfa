# pyfa

## What the fork
This motherforking shirtballs is a **badly** built version of the regular pyfa that gets a fit as base64 in the command line, prints its statistics in json and then quits. Its quality is horribly low, mainly due to my thousands of seconds of experience with python.


## Usage
